# Uber Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an **exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber trip data** to uncover insights into ride patterns, trip distribution, and customer behavior. Using Python and data visualization techniques, we analyze trends in ride frequency, peak hours, and location-based demand.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains trip records including pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, fare amounts, and trip distances. The main columns include:
- **Pickup Date/Time**: Timestamp of when the trip started.
- **Dropoff Date/Time**: Timestamp of when the trip ended.
- **Pickup Longitude & Latitude**: GPS coordinates of pickup locations.
- **Dropoff Longitude & Latitude**: GPS coordinates of drop-off locations.
- **Fare Amount**: Cost of the trip in USD.
- **Trip Distance**: Distance traveled during the trip.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze **peak ride hours** to determine the busiest time of the day.
- Visualize **trip distribution** across different locations.
- Study **fare trends** based on distance and time of day.
- Identify **demand hotspots** for Uber rides.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data analysis & visualization)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical analysis)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **Geopandas & Folium** (for geographical data visualization)

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sparshraj077/uber-data-analysis.git
   cd uber-data-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn geopandas folium
   ```
3. Run the analysis script:
   ```sh
   python uber_analysis.py
   ```

## 📌 Key Insights
- Peak ride hours occur **between 7-9 AM and 5-8 PM**, aligning with rush hours.
- The most frequent pickup locations are **city centers and airports**.
- **Fare prices increase** significantly during peak demand hours.
- High demand for rides during **weekends and holidays**.

## 📈 Visualizations
Some key plots generated during analysis include:
- **Histogram of Trip Frequency by Hour**
- **Heatmaps of Pickup & Drop-off Locations**
- **Boxplot of Fare Amount vs. Distance**
- **Time Series Analysis of Ride Demand**

## 🏆 Future Improvements
- Implement **real-time ride demand forecasting**.
- Incorporate **weather and traffic data** to enhance analysis.
- Use **machine learning models** to predict surge pricing.
